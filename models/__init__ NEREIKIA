# Python Package Definition:

# A folder with an __init__.py file is considered a package. 
# Without this file, Python does not recognize the folder as a package, 
# and importing modules within that folder becomes unreliable.
# If models is not recognized as a package, importing models like 
# from models.employee import Employee may fail or not work as expected in 
# Alembic's env.py or during your application runtime.

# SQLAlchemy Metadata Registration:
# SQLAlchemy uses Base.metadata to track all tables defined in your models.
# If models are not correctly imported, their tables will not be registered with 
# Base.metadata, causing Base.metadata.tables.keys() to be empty.

# Alembic and Model Import:
# Alembicâ€™s env.py relies on target_metadata being populated with your 
# SQLAlchemy model metadata (Base.metadata).
# Without proper imports (due to missing __init__.py), 
# Alembic won't detect your models or their tables, resulting in empty migrations.
